                        <p>Although I know school is very important, it is also important to have other interests and hobbies to be a well-rounded person. Throughout my life I have involved myself in a variety of things in order to better enjoy life and develope new skills!</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Lacrosse</h2>
                        <p>I started playing lacrosse in 8th grade and continue on through my first year at SVU. When I started, I didn't have much natural athletic ability, but I wanted to prove that hard work pays off more than natural talent. I went to practice early and left late every day and would often work out on my own. By my senior year of high school, I was one of the top scorers on the team and was playing at a level that allowed me to walk onto a competetive east coast college team.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Choir</h2>
                        <p>In high school I was never very out going and wanted to challenge myself with something that would push me to interact and even perform in front of people. I joined the men's high school choir my freshman year, which was a low level and audition-free class. It was fun, but I wanted to take it further, so for the next couple years I grew my skill level and worked my way up through more advanced group until i eventually made it into the exclusive, high-level a capella choir. We had a great time and would often travel around the city doing paid gigs, which was very rewarding.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Mixed Martial Arts</h2>
                        <p>When I tranferred to BYU, I knew that I would no longer be playing lacrosse, but I still wanted to involve myself with something phisical, and this time, a little more intense. I found an MMA gym and joined. I had no martial arts background and had never even gotten in a real fight before, but after a few months, I had worked myself to a skill level where my coaches were comfortable with arranging an official fight for me. March of 2023 I had my debut match, where I won by TKO in the first round. It was rewarding and I enjoy training a lot. As of now I am looking to increase my skills and compete more in the future.</p>
